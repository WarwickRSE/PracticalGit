--------------------------------------
'One'
	Branches have different final cases, D and E
	Graph  is:
* 55f99f3 (HEAD, master) Add case 'E'
| * e62d478 (feature) Add 'D'
|/  
* 1f79053 Initial file

	Merging gives a conflict because can't auto-resolve the two cases. Git uses surrounding lines for context and in this case the previous lines and the 'ENDIF' fool it

	Conflict is easily fixed by removing markers. May want to reorder cases for clarity though!!!
	
	Extra: merge is clean in sane implementation of the 'F' case. History is now mixed together though, 
* 504b102 (HEAD, master, feature) Add 'F' case
*   3c46582 Merge branch 'feature'
|\  
| * e62d478 Add 'D'
* | 55f99f3 Add case 'E'
|/  
* 1f79053 Initial file


-------------------------------------
'Two'

	One uses 'greet' the other 'greeting', and the set and print are in different places

	Result has conflict over namings, and identifies the two prints as different operations

	Extra: yes, putting prints in same place lets them be identified as the same and gives a second conflict

-------------------------------------
'Three'
Mainly Whitespace, also one has 'd' and 'f' cases as well as 'e'
Mostly because of the whitespace
This helps a lot
This also helps although gets a bit too fine perhaps

-------------------------------------
'Four'
There is a conflict between the reverted code and the new code, even though the reverted code is no longer 'there'
It doesn't compile, because the definition of 'greet' was reverted
New conflict is between values of 'greet'

  Extra: you could create a patch, although there's a chance this wont apply smoothly. You could run the revert without committing, and then add only the changes you want. You can also give up, create a diff and reapply the changes by hand. 

-------------------------------------
'Five'
The addition to convert has accidentally been matched into convert_silent. Also, the new modules have to be merged by hand.

-------------------------------------
'Test'
Mostly the changes have to be done completely by hand.
